# incurance
The dataset contains the following variables: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges. It is necessary to predict insurance payments on these predictors
This is a training model. The project carried out an exploratory data analysis and built predictive models based on log. regression, linear regression and a neural network. Because not enough predictors, accuracy estimates are small. Min estimate of MAE 0.062 fo model with three predictors. Also prediction model was built for target variable is smokeer. A very good accuracy has been achieved: for logistic regression this estimate is 91% for test sample, for MLP - 80%. This score may be higher for MLP, if change the function of activation and add more hidden layers and resize them.
